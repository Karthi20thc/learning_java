Sure! Let’s **explain group 4 (Non-access Modifiers)** with **simple definitions + real-world examples** so you can remember them easily.

---

# ✅ **4. Non-Access Modifiers in Java**

These keywords modify how **classes, methods, and variables** behave.
They control features like immutability, inheritance, threading, memory, and serialization.

We will cover each with a **simple explanation + real-world example**.

---

# 🔹 **1. static** — *belongs to the class, not objects*

### 📘 Meaning

A static variable/method is shared by **all objects of a class**.

### ⭐ Real World Example

Think of a **school**:

* Each student has their own *name, age* → object variables
* But **schoolName** is the same for everyone → static variable

### 📌 Code:

```java
class Student {
    static String schoolName = "ABC School"; // Shared by all students
    String name;
}
```

---

# 🔹 **2. final** — *cannot be changed/overridden*

### 📘 Meaning

* final variable → value cannot change
* final method → cannot be overridden
* final class → cannot be inherited

### ⭐ Real World Example

Your **Aadhaar number** or **passport number**
→ once assigned, it never changes → final.

### 📌 Code:

```java
final int ADHAAR = 1234567890; // cannot change
```

---

# 🔹 **3. abstract** — *incomplete class or method*

### 📘 Meaning

* abstract class → cannot be instantiated
* abstract method → no body, must be implemented in child classes

### ⭐ Real World Example

A **vehicle blueprint**:

* You cannot create a generic “Vehicle” (abstract)
* But you can create **Car**, **Bike**, **Truck** (concrete classes)

### 📌 Code:

```java
abstract class Vehicle {
    abstract void start(); // no implementation
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    void start() {
        System.out.println("Car starts with key");
    }
}
```

---

# 🔹 **4. synchronized** — *thread-safe method/block*

### 📘 Meaning

Only **one thread** can execute the synchronized method at a time.

### ⭐ Real World Example

Think of an ATM machine:

* Only **one person** can withdraw money at a time from a particular account
  → prevents race conditions

### 📌 Code:

```java
synchronized void withdraw(int amount) {
    balance -= amount;
}
```

---

# 🔹 **5. volatile** — *variable is always read from main memory*

### 📘 Meaning

Makes sure threads read the **latest value**, not a cached version.

### ⭐ Real World Example

Imagine a **shared notice board**:

* When someone updates the notice, everyone should see the **latest message**.

### 📌 Code:

```java
volatile boolean isRunning = true;
```

---

# 🔹 **6. transient** — *skip during serialization*

### 📘 Meaning

When you save an object to a file/network, **transient fields are not saved**.

### ⭐ Real World Example

If you save a bank user profile:

* You should store name, account number
* But **not the password** → transient

### 📌 Code:

```java
class User {
    String name;
    transient String password; // will not be saved
}
```

---

# 🔹 **7. native** — *method implemented in C/C++*

### 📘 Meaning

Used when Java wants to call a **platform-specific function**.

### ⭐ Real World Example

Java calling:

* Windows API
* Printer drivers
* GPU-accelerated native code

### 📌 Code:

```java
native void printDocument();
```

---

# 🔹 **8. strictfp** — *consistent floating-point calculation*

### 📘 Meaning

Ensures floating-point math stays the same on **every OS/CPU**.

### ⭐ Real World Example

Banking and scientific apps require **precise** calculations everywhere.
strictfp avoids differences between processors.

### 📌 Code:

```java
strictfp class Calculator {
    double add(double a, double b) { return a + b; }
}
```

| Modifier     | Real World Analogy                                |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| static       | One common school name shared by all students     |
| final        | Aadhaar/passport number (cannot change)           |
| abstract     | Generic “Vehicle” blueprint; cannot create object |
| synchronized | ATM queue (one person at a time)                  |
| volatile     | Noticeboard everyone reads updated value from     |
| transient    | Password not saved in a file                      |
| native       | Using Windows OS or C/C++ code directly           |
| strictfp     | Same calculation result on every machine          |
